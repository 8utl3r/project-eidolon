# Logic Structures & Graph Modifiers Design

## Session: CHARLIE DELTA (Design)
**Status**: In Progress
**Goal**: Deep dive into formalized logic structures, programming implementations, knowledge graph integration, and graph modifiers

## Topics to Explore

### 1. Formalized Logic Structures
**Status**: In Progress
**Focus Areas**:
- Propositional logic
- Predicate logic
- Modal logic
- Temporal logic
- Fuzzy logic (amplitude-based representation)
- Non-monotonic logic
- Gravitational strain analogy for confidence scoring

### 2. Logic Implementation in Programming
**Status**: Pending
**Focus Areas**:
- Prolog and logic programming
- Expert systems
- Rule engines
- Constraint satisfaction
- Limitations and failures
- Success stories

### 3. Logic Integration with Knowledge Graphs
**Status**: Pending
**Focus Areas**:
- RDF and semantic web
- OWL ontologies
- SPARQL queries
- Reasoning engines
- Graph-based logic representation

### 4. Graph Modifiers (Third Element)
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Focus Areas**:
- Naming: "Strands" (single syllable, matches nodes/edges)
- Strand function: Quantify strain values between nodes
- Structure: [context_node][strand][modifier_node][strand][action_node]
- Dream sequence: Experiment with new node connections and strain values
- Integration: Fully integrated into technical architecture

## Research Questions

### Logic Structures
- Which logic systems are most relevant for AI reasoning?
- How do different logic types handle uncertainty?
- What are the computational complexity trade-offs?

### Strain-Based Logic Representation
- How can gravitational strain model modal logic accessibility?
- How does strain interference represent non-monotonic reasoning?
- What are the computational implications of strain-based confidence?

### Programming History
- Why did logic programming decline in popularity?
- What were the key limitations of expert systems?
- How can we learn from past failures?

### Knowledge Graph Integration
- How do existing systems represent logical rules in graphs?
- What are the performance implications?
- How do we handle logical contradictions?

### Graph Modifiers
- What should we call the third element?
- How do modifiers interact with nodes and edges?
- What types of modifiers do we need?
