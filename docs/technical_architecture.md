# Technical Architecture

## Session: BRAVO CHARLIE (Design)
**Status**: In Progress
**Goal**: Define detailed technical architecture for AI platform

## Core Architecture Overview

### Database Layer: LMDB (Lightning Memory-Mapped Database) + Nim
- **Knowledge Graph Storage**: Entities and relationships in LMDB
- **Act Graph Storage**: Events, actions, temporal data in LMDB
- **Vector Storage**: Semantic embeddings in LMDB
- **Strain System**: Gravitational strain-based confidence scoring
- **Memory Hierarchy**: Multi-level memory management
- **Integration**: Direct Nim bindings for optimal performance

### Processing Layer
- **Foreground Agent**: Decision-making and user interaction with database synthesis
- **Background Agents**: The Engineer, The Skeptic, The Stage Manager, The Dreamer, The Philosopher, The Investigator, The Archivist
- **RAG System**: External knowledge integration
- **System States**: wake, dream, sleep
- **Local LLM Backend**: Ollama (runs local large language models for agentic reasoning; agents send prompts to Ollama's HTTP API)

### Integration Layer
- **Graph Synchronization**: Between knowledge, act, and vector layers
- **Processor Communication**: Foreground-background coordination
- **Confidence Updates**: Real-time confidence scoring

## Strain Calculation System

### Core Strain Concepts
The gravitational strain metaphor models confidence as gravitational forces between nodes:

#### Amplitude (Strain Intensity)
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (no strain to maximum strain)
- **Calculation**: Based on confidence counter, access frequency, and decay
- **Formula**: `amplitude = (access_count * access_factor) / (decay_rate ^ time_since_access)`

#### Resistance (Strain Flow Resistance)
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (no resistance to maximum resistance)
- **Purpose**: Determines how easily strain flows to/from this node
- **Calculation**: Based on node type, relationship strength, and historical stability

#### Frequency (Context Indexing)
- **Purpose**: Tracks how often this node appears in different contexts
- **Usage**: Higher frequency indicates broader contextual relevance
- **Calculation**: Count of unique contexts where node appears

#### Direction (Strain Flow Vector)
- **Purpose**: Indicates preferred strain flow direction
- **Components**: 3D vector (x, y, z) representing flow preference
- **Calculation**: Based on connected nodes and their strain values

### Strain Calculation Algorithms
**Source**: Strain system implementation from Session IRON WOLF

#### Amplitude Calculation
```nim
proc calculateAmplitude(access_count: int, access_factor: float, 
                       decay_rate: float, time_since_access: float): float =
  # Calculate strain amplitude using decay formula
  let decay_factor = pow(decay_rate, time_since_access)
  let raw_amplitude = float(access_count) * access_factor
  let amplitude = raw_amplitude / decay_factor
  return clamp(amplitude, 0.0, 1.0)  # Ensure 0.0-1.0 range

proc updateAmplitude(node: var Entity): void =
  # Update amplitude when node is accessed
  let time_since = getCurrentTime() - node.strain.last_accessed
  node.strain.amplitude = calculateAmplitude(
    node.strain.access_count,
    access_factor,  # Global parameter (typically 1.1)
    decay_rate,     # Global parameter (typically 0.95)
    time_since
  )
```

#### Resistance Calculation
```nim
proc calculateResistance(node: Entity, connections: seq[Relationship]): float =
  # Calculate resistance based on node stability and connections
  let connection_strength = sum(connections.map(proc(r: Relationship): float =
    return r.strain.amplitude * r.attributes.getOrDefault("strength", "1.0").parseFloat
  ))
  
  let stability_factor = 1.0 - (node.strain.frequency / max_frequency)  # More stable = higher resistance
  let connection_factor = 1.0 - (connection_strength / max_connections)  # Fewer connections = higher resistance
  
  let resistance = (stability_factor + connection_factor) / 2.0
  return clamp(resistance, 0.0, 1.0)

proc updateResistance(node: var Entity, connections: seq[Relationship]): void =
  node.strain.resistance = calculateResistance(node, connections)
```

#### Frequency Calculation
```nim
proc updateFrequency(node: var Entity, context_id: string): void =
  # Update frequency when node appears in new context
  if not node.contexts.contains(context_id):
    node.contexts.add(context_id)
    node.strain.frequency = len(node.contexts)
```

#### Direction Calculation
```nim
proc calculateDirection(node: Entity, connections: seq[Relationship]): Vector3 =
  # Calculate strain flow direction based on connected nodes
  var direction = Vector3(x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0)
  var total_weight = 0.0
  
  for connection in connections:
    let connected_node = getEntity(connection.to_entity_id)
    let strain_difference = connected_node.strain.amplitude - node.strain.amplitude
    let weight = abs(strain_difference) * connection.strain.amplitude
    
    # Direction vector from this node to connected node
    let node_direction = getNodeDirection(node, connected_node)
    direction.x += node_direction.x * weight
    direction.y += node_direction.y * weight
    direction.z += node_direction.z * weight
    total_weight += weight
  
  # Normalize direction vector
  if total_weight > 0.0:
    direction.x /= total_weight
    direction.y /= total_weight
    direction.z /= total_weight
  
  return direction

proc updateDirection(node: var Entity, connections: seq[Relationship]): void =
  node.strain.direction = calculateDirection(node, connections)
```

#### Strain Flow Between Nodes
```nim
proc calculateStrainFlow(from_node: Entity, to_node: Entity, 
                        connection: Relationship): StrainFlow =
  # Calculate how strain flows from one node to another
  let strain_difference = from_node.strain.amplitude - to_node.strain.amplitude
  
  # Strain flows from high to low amplitude
  if strain_difference <= 0.0:
    return StrainFlow(flow_amount: 0.0, direction: Vector3(x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0))
  
  # Calculate flow resistance
  let total_resistance = from_node.strain.resistance + to_node.strain.resistance
  let connection_resistance = connection.strain.resistance
  
  # Flow amount based on strain difference and resistance
  let flow_amount = strain_difference * (1.0 - total_resistance) * (1.0 - connection_resistance)
  
  # Flow direction from high strain to low strain
  let direction = normalize(to_node.position - from_node.position)
  
  return StrainFlow(flow_amount: flow_amount, direction: direction)

type StrainFlow = object
  flow_amount: float           # Amount of strain flowing
  direction: Vector3           # Direction of flow
```

#### Strain Interference Patterns
```nim
proc calculateStrainInterference(node: Entity, connections: seq[Relationship]): float =
  # Calculate strain interference from multiple connections
  var interference = 0.0
  
  for i, connection1 in connections:
    for j, connection2 in connections:
      if i != j:
        let flow1 = calculateStrainFlow(node, getEntity(connection1.to_entity_id), connection1)
        let flow2 = calculateStrainFlow(node, getEntity(connection2.to_entity_id), connection2)
        
        # Interference based on flow direction similarity
        let dot_product = flow1.direction.dot(flow2.direction)
        let interference_factor = (1.0 + dot_product) / 2.0  # 0.0 to 1.0
        
        interference += flow1.flow_amount * flow2.flow_amount * interference_factor
  
  return interference
```

## Throne-Based Domain Authority System

### Domain Authority Mechanism
**Source**: Throne-based domain discussion from Session SHADOW FOX

The throne-based domain system creates emergent authority through graph connections rather than rigid categories:

#### Throne Nodes
- Each agent has a throne node (e.g., `ThroneOfTheMathematician`)
- Throne nodes serve as authority centers for their domains
- Thrones have strain-based confidence scoring like other entities
- Authority level determines activation type (permanent vs triggered)

#### Domain Authority Emergence
- Domain jurisdiction emerges through graph connections
- Nodes connected to a throne fall under that agent's authority
- Multiple thrones can connect to the same nodes (overlapping authority)
- Authority strength varies based on connection strength and strain

#### Authority Types
- **Permanent Authority**: Stage Manager, Archivist (always active)
- **Triggered Authority**: Dreamer, Philosopher, Mathematician, Skeptic, Investigator (activated by conditions)

#### Dynamic Authority
- As new connections form, relevant domains automatically assert authority
- Authority can shift as strain patterns change
- Emergent behavior through overlapping authority patterns
- Natural domain boundaries through graph relationships

### Domain Authority Operations
```nim
# Check which agents have authority over an entity
proc getEntityAuthorities(entity_id: string): seq[ThroneNode] =
  # Query domain authority records
  # Return thrones with authority over this entity
  # Sort by authority strength

# Assert domain authority over an entity
proc assertDomainAuthority(throne_id: string, entity_id: string, strength: float) =
  # Create or update domain authority record
  # Update strain values
  # Trigger relevant agent if needed

# Remove domain authority
proc removeDomainAuthority(throne_id: string, entity_id: string) =
  # Remove domain authority record
  # Update strain values
  # Notify relevant agents
```

## Integration Architecture

### Agent Communication Protocol
**Source**: Agent architecture discussion from Session ALPHA BRAVO

#### Database-Only Communication Pattern
All agent communication occurs exclusively through LMDB read/write operations:

```

#### Agent Trigger/Activation System

  # Check domain authority changes
  # Detect pattern matches
  # Return triggered agents with priorities
```

#### Multithreaded Agent Coordination
**Source**: Multithreaded architecture from Session ALPHA BRAVO

Each agent runs in a separate thread with coordinated database access:

## AI Database Interaction Design

### Database Access Patterns

**Foreground Processor Access:**
```nim
# Direct database access for decision-making
proc queryKnowledge(query: string): seq[Node] =
  # Search knowledge graph for relevant nodes
  # Update confidence scores on access
  # Return ranked results

proc createAct(actor: Node, action: string, target: Node): Edge =
  # Create new act graph edge
  # Link to knowledge nodes
  # Initialize strain values
```

**Background Agent Access:**
```nim
# Context-triggered processing
proc mathematician() =
  # Triggered by mathematical context
  # Scan for mathematical patterns
  # Perform calculations
  # Update confidence scores
  # Create new mathematical relationships

proc skeptic() =
  # Triggered by anomalies, contradictions, or logical reasoning needs
  # Monitor strain patterns
  # Detect anomalies and contradictions
  # Apply logical reasoning
  # Flag suspicious nodes
  # Trigger dream sequences

proc stageManager() =
  # Triggered by context changes or temporal/spatial information
  # Track conversation context
  # Manage temporal and spatial relationships
  # Update relevance scores

proc dreamer() =
  # Triggered by idle time or high strain
  # Analyze strain patterns
  # Propose creative modifications
  # Test new connections
  # Optimize graph structure

proc philosopher() =
  # Triggered by pattern recognition or after dreamer resolves contradictions
  # Analyze ontological structures
  # Identify statistical patterns in node relationships
  # Extrapolate new knowledge from existing patterns
  # Propose new ontological categories
  # Generate hypotheses for knowledge extension

proc investigator() =
  # Triggered by new knowledge or investigation requests
  # Catalog new knowledge
  # Find connections between nodes
  # Identify knowledge gaps
  # Suggest investigation directions
  # Influence foreground AI focus

proc archivist() =
  # Triggered by high confidence or deep sleep cycle
  # Move knowledge to long-term storage
  # Require agent approvals
  # Analyze system efficiency
  # Generate performance reports
  # Optimize memory structures

### AI Query Interface

**Natural Language Queries:**
```nim
# Convert natural language to graph queries
proc parseQuery(query: string): GraphQuery =
  # Extract entities, actions, relationships
  # Map to graph structure
  # Generate strain-aware query

# Example: "What causes birds to fly?"
# Becomes: [birds] --[causes]--> [fly]
```

**Strain-Aware Retrieval:**
```nim
# Consider confidence scores in retrieval
proc strainAwareQuery(query: GraphQuery): seq[Result] =
  # Execute graph traversal
  # Weight results by strain values
  # Filter low-confidence results
  # Return ranked results
```

### Dream AI Database Operations

**Strain Analysis:**
```nim
proc analyzeStrain(node: Node): StrainReport =
  # Calculate total strain on node
  # Identify strain sources
  # Predict strain relief strategies
  # Return optimization recommendations
```

**Graph Modification:**
```nim
proc dreamModification(original: Node, modification: Strand): ModificationResult =
  # Test modification on copy
  # Calculate strain relief
  # Validate against existing knowledge
  # Apply if beneficial
```

### Database Schema for AI Operations

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Emergent Behavior Complexity**: System may not produce expected emergent patterns
- **Agent Coordination**: Background agents may conflict or deadlock
- **Performance**: Graph operations may become slow with large datasets
- **Multithreading**: Race conditions and data consistency issues

### Medium Risk  
- **Strain System Tuning**: Parameters may need extensive experimentation
- **RAG Integration**: External knowledge may not integrate well with graph structure
- **Agent Independence**: Complete separation may limit emergent interactions

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with simple test cases and gradually increase complexity
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Create fallback mechanisms for agent failures
- Build performance testing early
- Use database transactions for data consistency
- Implement configurable experimentation parameters
