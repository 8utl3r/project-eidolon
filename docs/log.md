Log will be a record of all changes at a conceptual level. We'll use .git for keeping track of code changes but the log will give a short description of what was done and why with any necessary context for understanding after it edits any file except log. Timestamp each line. Record in log format separated by session ID. Session IDs will be recorded at the start of every session starting with this session as Session ID: 1a4. Session IDs are in hexadecimal.
